# Specification Quality Checklist: Unused Assets Detector

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification describes WHAT and WHY without HOW
- Focused on user problems (asset bloat) and business outcomes (smaller apps, faster builds, lower costs)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements use reasonable industry defaults
- Requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "scan specified project directory recursively")
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (e.g., "under 10 seconds", "95%+ accuracy", "below 5% false positive rate")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details - focused on user-facing outcomes
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format with concrete conditions
- Edge cases cover important boundary conditions (dynamic references, permissions, large files, etc.)
- Scope is well-defined with 4 prioritized user stories
- Assumptions section documents 8 key assumptions about environment and usage

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- User scenarios progress from MVP (P1: scanning) to advanced features (P4: team reports)
- Success criteria are independently verifiable without knowing implementation
- No technology stack, programming languages, frameworks, or APIs mentioned

## Notes

The specification successfully balances completeness with simplicity. It made informed decisions on:
- Standard asset file extensions (jpg, png, svg, ttf, woff, mp4, etc.) - documented in A-008
- Offline operation as default (FR-013) - standard for CLI tools
- Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, plain text) - industry standard for developer tools
- Performance targets (10 seconds for 1000 files, 100K file support) - reasonable for file scanning tools

No spec updates required. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
